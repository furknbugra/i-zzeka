Startups can be founded by one or more entrepreneurs who are working on developing a product or service.  Startups normally have very high cost and limited revenue. As they require a lot of capital to take it off the ground, they look for capital from a lot of sources like venture capitalists. \n\nStartups go through multiple rounds of funding to raise capital. The different funding rounds that let outside investors the opportunity to invest cash in exchange of equity or partial ownership of the company. Other types of investments are debt, convertible note, stock or dividends.  Startups can start off with “seed” funding or angel investor funding at the beginning. The next funding rounds  can be followed by  Series A, B, C and so on. Goal of most startups is to get acquired by a different company or become a publicly traded company.\n\n90% of startups fail due to bad product market fit, marketing problems, team problems or other issues. They also fail within the first few years. This makes startup investment very risky. Historically only venture capitalists could invest in startups but due to the recent trend in crowdfunding sites, an average investor can easily grab a piece of an exciting startup.
